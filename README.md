# draft-web-portfolio-prototype
Hihi this a v amateur based HTML, CSS, JS that i created. Would like to see some advice on how to further enhance this as a portfolio instead of using linkedin.

Looking to add weblinks and places to showcase photographs/artwork/content creation projects on HTML which potientially ventures into NFT links
Thank you!
